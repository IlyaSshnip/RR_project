'''The Value at Risk (VaR) calculations and backtesting results for the S&P 500, Bitcoin, and U.S. 1-Year Treasury Bills provide insightful reflections on the risk profiles of these assets. 
Notably, the S&P 500 shows a moderate risk with a 1-day VaR of -1.72%, aligning closely with typical market expectations for a major equity index. Bitcoin, reflecting its well-known volatility, 
presents significantly higher risk levels with a 1-day VaR of -5.74%, which is crucial for investors to consider in risk management and capital allocation strategies. T
he U.S. Treasury Bill, unexpectedly, shows an unusually high VaR, suggesting either data anomalies or extraordinary market conditions, which warrants further investigation. 
The close alignment of the exceedance rates with the expected 5% threshold across all assets confirms the accuracy and reliability of the VaR models in capturing the tail risk within the specified confidence interval, 
underscoring their utility in financial risk assessment and strategic planning.'''
